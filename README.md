# -Health-Insurance-Trends-Post-Affordable-Care-Act-ACA-

__**Overview:**__ 

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of health insurance coverage trends across U.S. states, with a focus on the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid expansion, and Medicare enrollment. Using publicly available datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau, Department of Health and Human Services, and Kaggle, the study visualizes how coverage types evolved from 2008 to 2023 and how policy changes influenced uninsured rates.

__**Objectives:**__

- Identify patterns in adoption of direct-purchase, employer-based, Medicaid, and Medicare coverage
- Compare uninsured rate changes between Medicaid-expanding and non-expanding states
- Evaluate the ACA’s influence on coverage accessibility and enrollment shifts
- Highlight regional disparities in insurance coverage and policy outcomes

__**Datasets:**__

_Dataset 1:_ State-level coverage data (2008–2023), including estimates and percentages for various insurance types
_Dataset 2:_ ACA impact data (2010–2016), including uninsured rate changes, Medicaid/Medicare enrollment, and marketplace tax credits

__**Tools & Technologies:**__

- Tableau: For building interactive dashboards, symbol maps, bar graphs, line charts, and a multi-part Tableau Story
- Excel: For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for visualization
- Public Data Sources: U.S. Census Bureau, HHS, Kaggle

**__Visualizations & Storytelling:__**

- Symbol Maps showing coverage estimates by state and insurance type
- Bar Graphs comparing average coverage estimates across categories
- Line Charts tracking coverage trends over time (2008–2023)
- Uninsured Rate Line Chart comparing state-wise changes from 2010 to 2015
- Map Chart visualizing Medicaid enrollment changes (2013–2016)
- Table Chart showing Medicare enrollment by state (2016)
- Horizontal Bar Chart illustrating average coverage change across states

**Tableau Story:** A structured narrative combining all visualizations to guide viewers through the ACA’s impact and coverage evolution

**__Key Insights:__**

- States like California saw the largest gains in coverage post-ACA, especially in Medicaid enrollment
- Texas had the highest uninsured rate in 2010, while Massachusetts had the lowest
- Medicaid expansion was strongly correlated with reductions in uninsured rates
- Medicare enrollment patterns reflected demographic and policy-driven differences across states

__**Conclusion:**__
The project demonstrates the ACA’s effectiveness in expanding health coverage and reducing uninsured rates, especially in states that adopted Medicaid expansion. The Tableau Story provides a clear, visual narrative that supports data-driven policy evaluation and highlights areas for future reform.
